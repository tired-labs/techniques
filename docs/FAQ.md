# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** *Can I contribute to the repository?*  
**A:** YES! We would love to receive contributions of excellent technique
research and modeling! To begin contributing, please follow the information
detailed in the [Contribution Guide].

**Q:** *What if my technique is partially covered by an existing TRR?*  
**A:** Make your recommended updates to the existing TRR and submit a new PR.
Good work can always get better!

**Q:** *Can I submit a TRR for an Execution tactic?*  
**A:** We are unlikely to accept TRRs for a technique under the "Execution"
tactic. This is because most techniques under "Execution" are actually tools
instead of techniques. Tools aren't techniques, they are just a vehicle by which
an action (malicious or legitimate) can be taken. For example, "Powershell" is a
tool that can implement nearly all techniques! You can find more detail at
[Mistaken Identification: When an Attack Technique isn't a Technique]. If you
submit a TRR for one of these techniques, we'll probably ask you to re-scope the
TRR to whatever technique it's actually addressing.
